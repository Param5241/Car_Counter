# 🚗 Real-Time Car Counting System

## 📌 Overview
This project implements a **real-time car counting system** using **YOLO object detection** and **OpenCV**. The system processes a **video feed**, detects vehicles, and counts **incoming and outgoing cars** by tracking their movement across predefined lines.

## 🔹 Features
- ✅ **Real-time vehicle detection using YOLOv8**
- ✅ **Counts incoming and outgoing cars**
- ✅ **Draws bounding boxes and tracking lines**
- ✅ **Displays real-time vehicle count on the video feed**

## 🛠️ Technologies Used
- **Python** – Programming language
- **OpenCV & cvzone** – Image processing & visualization
- **YOLOv8** – Object detection
- **NumPy** – Data manipulation
